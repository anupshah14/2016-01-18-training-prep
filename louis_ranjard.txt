My name is Louis Ranjard, I am lab manager in Allen Rodrigo's group at the Australian National University. I plan on taking part on running some workshops related to Computational Biology for the Research School of Biology students and staff. My research interests focus on the development and the application of computational methods for Phylogeography and Bioacoustics.
