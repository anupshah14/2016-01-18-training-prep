I am a senior post-doctoral researcher in Microbial Genomics at the University of Queensland, studying how bacteria evolve to become highly virulent superbugs and spread to cause outbreraks and epidemics. Having a Biochemistry background, I am mostly self-taught in Bash, Python and R, and would consider myself beginner/intermediate as I don't do coding on a daily basis (apart from Bash).
